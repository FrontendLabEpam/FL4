# MVC

.img-wrap-70[![MVC](assets/img/mvc.png)]

- Model–View–Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces.
- Since 1979 (Trygve Reenskaug). Smalltalk-80 (Jim Althoff)
- It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.

# MVC + JS

- Model–View–Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces.
- Since 1979 (Trygve Reenskaug). Smalltalk-80 (Jim Althoff)
- It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.

# Model

```javascript
    var ModelExample = function (data){    
        this.name = data.name;
        this.surname = data.surname;
        return this;
    };
```
Model is where the application’s data objects are stored.
- Doesn’t know anything about views and controllers.
- Notifies its associated views and controllers when there has been a change in its state.
- May have additional features: conversions, validations, computed properties, access control.




---

# View

```javascript
    var ViewExample = function (model){
        this.model = model;    
        this.render = function (){
            $('#user-info').text(this.model.name + ' ' + this.model.surname);
        }
        return this;
    };
```
View requests information from the model that it needs for generating an output representation to the user.

- Doesn’t care how to get the data or where the data comes from.

- May use the existing HTML or may build new HTML

---

# Controller

```javascript
    var ControllerExample = function () {
        this.init = function () {
            var model = new ModelExample({
                name: 'Vova',
                surname: 'Putin'
            });
            var view = new ViewExample(model);
        }
        return this;
    };
```
Decision maker and the glue between the model and view.

- Updates the model when the user manipulates the view

---

# MVP

.img-wrap-70[![MVP](assets/img/mvp.png)]

- Model-view-presenter (MVP) is a derivative of the MVC design pattern which focuses on improving presentation logic.
- Since 1990 (Taligent)
- Presenter is a component which contains the user-interface business logic for the view
- Passive View

---

# MVVM

.img-wrap-70[![MVVM](assets/img/mvvm.png)]

- MVVM (Model View ViewModel) is an architectural pattern based on MVC and MVP, which attempts to more clearly separate the development of user-interfaces (UI) from that of the business logic and behaviour in an application.
- Since 2005 (Silverlight)
- KnockoutJS, Kendo MVVM 

---

# ViewModel

```javascript
    function ViewModel() {
        this.presidents = ko.observableArray([
            {name: 'Vova', surname: 'Putin'},
            {name: 'Barack', surname: 'Obama'},
        ]);
        this.onButtonClick = function () {
            alert('click');
        };
    }

    ko.applyBindings(new ViewModel());
```
The ViewModel can be considered a specialized Controller that acts as a data converter. 

- Changes Model information into View information passing commands from the View to the Model.

---

# Template(View)

```html
    <ul data-bind="foreach: presidents">
        <li>
            <span data-bind="text: name"></span>
            <span data-bind="text: surname"></span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <a data-bind="click: onButtonClick">Button</a>
```
View is simply a HTML document with declarative bindings to link it to the ViewModel

- Displays information from the ViewModel, pass commands to it
- Specific syntax.

---

# MVC vs MVP vs MVVM

What should I use?

- Data binding (MVVM)
- Connection between the view and the rest of the program is not always available (MVC)
- Any other case (MVP)
